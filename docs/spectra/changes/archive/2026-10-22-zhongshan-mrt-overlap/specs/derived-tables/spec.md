## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Day eligibility

A day D SHALL be loaded only when `bus_event/<D>/` contains at least one hour file, `static/<D>/` contains `GetRoute.gz`, `GetStop.gz` and `GetPathDetail.gz`, the read window of D has ended, shown by an hour file `bus_event/<D+1>/01.jsonl` or `bus_event/<D+1>/01.jsonl.gz`, and `external/taipei-mrt-exits/` contains at least one MRT entrance snapshot. A day that fails these checks SHALL fail with a message naming the missing file or directory; a missing snapshot SHALL name `bin/rails external:mrt_exits`.

#### Scenario: Read window not over

- **WHEN** the task is asked for a day whose next day has no 01 hour file yet
- **THEN** that day fails with a message naming the missing hour file and nothing is written for it

#### Scenario: No entrance snapshot

- **WHEN** the data root has no file under `external/taipei-mrt-exits/`
- **THEN** the day fails with a message naming `bin/rails external:mrt_exits` and nothing is written for it

### Requirement: Derived export

For an eligible day the system SHALL run `analysis/params.sql`, every numbered stage file in file name order, then `analysis/mrt_overlap.sql` with the newest MRT entrance snapshot by file name date, and then `analysis/derived_export.sql`, which SHALL write five CSV files: the route day (route `Id`, name, departure, destination, static snapshot day, and the day of the entrance snapshot used), the stops of both directions (direction, sequence number, stop name, latitude, longitude, nearest entrance name and distance as defined by `mrt-overlap`), the trips of the day as defined by `trip-reconstruction` together with each trip's time band from `load-profile`, the layovers as defined by `layover-metrics` with the end time of the trip and the start time of the next trip, and the per-stop on-board counts of each trip as defined by `load-profile`. Timestamps SHALL be written with the `+08:00` offset. Rows SHALL be sorted so that two runs over the same input produce byte-identical files.

#### Scenario: Stage order shared with the health card

- **WHEN** `bin/health-card` and `derived:load` assemble their SQL
- **THEN** both put the variable settings first, `analysis/params.sql` second and the numbered stage files after it in file name order, and only `derived:load` appends `analysis/mrt_overlap.sql` and `analysis/derived_export.sql`

#### Scenario: Newest snapshot used

- **WHEN** the snapshot folder holds `2026-10-20.csv` and `2026-10-22.csv` and day 2026-10-19 is loaded
- **THEN** the distances come from `2026-10-22.csv` and the stored route day records 2026-10-22 as its entrance snapshot day
